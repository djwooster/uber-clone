Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Let me explain what this file does in simple terms:

This is like a storage room for all the important pieces of information (we call them "constants") 
that we use throughout our app. Think of it like a central place where we keep all our important stuff!

Here's what we have in this file:

1. Images and Icons: 
   At the top (not shown fully), we have a bunch of icons and images that we use in our app
   (like email, google, home icons, etc.). It's like having a folder of stickers ready to use!

2. Onboarding Screens:
   The 'onboarding' part is like a welcome tour for new users. It shows three screens:
   - First screen tells users they can find their ride
   - Second screen talks about having the best cars
   - Third screen explains how easy it is to use the app
   Each screen has:
   - An ID (to keep track of which screen is which)
   - A title (the big text you see)
   - A description (the smaller text explaining more)
   - An image (a picture to make it look nice)

3. Data Object:
   At the bottom, we have a 'data' object that helps organize everything neatly.
   It's like having a neat filing cabinet where we can find things easily!

This file helps keep our app organized and makes it easier to change things later.
Instead of hunting through many files to change something, we can just come here! ðŸ˜Š
